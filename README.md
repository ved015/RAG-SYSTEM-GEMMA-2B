# RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) USING GEMMMA-2B

RAG is a powerful framework that combines retrieval-based and generative-based approaches for question answering. It leverages pre-existing documents such as medical research papers to retrieve relevant information and generate precise answers based on them. RAG finds extensive application in medical diagnosis assistance, research literature exploration, educational purposes, and patient care, providing quick and accurate responses to medical queries.

## Features

- **Medical Research Papers:** Leveraging medical research papers as a comprehensive knowledge base, enabling the system to access a wide range of medical information.

- **ChromaDB Integration:** Utilizes ChromaDB, a specialized database designed for efficient storage and retrieval of medical data, ensuring fast access to relevant information.

- **Gemma Model for Question Answering:** Integrates Gemma model, a cutting-edge deep learning architecture trained specifically for accurate question answering in the medical domain, enhancing the system's ability to provide precise answers.
